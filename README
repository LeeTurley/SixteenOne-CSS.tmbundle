=== INSTALLATION ===

cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/

If the folder doesn't exist create it then clone into it.


====================

I use the mCSS Bundle all of the time, but there a few things missing from time to time, so this is my personnel Bundle to work along side it.
